## Features

- **Retrieve scientific papers** from open-access sources using [Pygetpapers](https://github.com/petermr/pygetpapers)
- **Extract named entities** using pre-trained spaCy or transformer-based models
- **Summarize full texts** or abstracts using transformer-based summarization models (e.g., BART, T5)
- **Ask questions** and get answers with RAG-based pipelines or custom LLMs
